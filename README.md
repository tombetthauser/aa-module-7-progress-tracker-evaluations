# Capstone PT Evaluations

TLDR: We need to be leaving more official evaluations on Progress Tracker, especially with students who are on their last deferral or their second capstone attempt and are in danger of being dismissed.

---

## Times to Consider Leaving an Evaluation:
* after circle standups
* after a one-on-one interaction with a student

## Negative Reasons to Leave an Evaluation
* unexcused absence from a standup
* missed a TA appointment on calendly
* did not do something they agreed to do
* interrupted, ignored or were unprofessional with TA
* was unresponsive or unclear during standups

## Neutral Reasons to Leave Evaluation:
* left TA feeling concerned about students success on capstone
* TA spent over 30 minutes working with student in breakout room
* student has asked few or no questions for 3+ days
* student has asked few or no questions after pregrading

## Positive Reasons to Leave Evaluation:
* project is clearly passing before pregrading
* outstandingly professional in TA interactions
* frequently asks clear focused questions
